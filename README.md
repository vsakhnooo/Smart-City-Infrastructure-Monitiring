🌆 Smart City Infrastructure Monitoring Using IoT and Cloud Computing 🌉
Project Overview 📋
This project aims to enhance the safety and efficiency of city infrastructure by developing an IoT-based solution that monitors critical infrastructure like bridges, roads, tunnels, and public utilities in real time. IoT sensors continuously track key parameters such as structural integrity, vibration, and environmental conditions, while data is transmitted to the cloud for analysis and storage. 🛠️ Predictive analytics help identify potential problems before they escalate, and real-time alerts enable city officials to take immediate action. 📊 Cloud integration allows for centralized monitoring of multiple assets, making the system scalable as cities grow.

Features ✨
1. Real-Time Infrastructure Monitoring 📡: Track key metrics like vibration, stress levels, and environmental conditions using IoT sensors.
2. Customizable Monitoring Thresholds ⚙️: Set specific alert thresholds for different infrastructure types (e.g., bridges, roads, tunnels).
3. City Official Alerts 📱: Receive instant notifications when infrastructure conditions exceed safe limits, prompting immediate intervention.
4. Automated Preventative Maintenance 🛠️: Integrate with maintenance systems to automate repair scheduling based on real-time data.
5. Data Logging & Reporting 🗄️: Log historical data for compliance, audit trails, and decision-making, ensuring traceability of infrastructure health.
6. Predictive Analytics 🔮: Use machine learning to predict potential structural failures or wear-and-tear based on historical data patterns.
7. Cloud Integration ☁️: Enable centralized monitoring for city authorities to manage and oversee multiple assets from anywhere.

User Stories 🧑‍💻
1. As a city official, I want to receive real-time alerts when infrastructure conditions (e.g., bridge vibrations or road degradation) exceed safe limits, so I can dispatch emergency repairs. 🚨
2. As a maintenance planner, I want to monitor the health of all infrastructure assets remotely from a central dashboard, ensuring that I can optimize maintenance schedules. 🛠️
3. As a public safety officer, I want the system to use predictive analytics to flag potential issues early, so I can prevent dangerous situations. 🔮
4. As a city planner, I want to access historical data for analysis, so I can make informed decisions on future infrastructure investments and improvements. 📊
5. As a city auditor, I want access to compliance reports that provide a detailed history of infrastructure monitoring and maintenance activities to ensure regulatory requirements are met. 📝
